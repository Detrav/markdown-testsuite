## Getting Involved

There are a number of ways to get involved with the development of the Markdown Test Suite. If you are a first time contributor to an open source project, you can still add value to this project. You may identify grammar issues, write prose, examples or documentation for the project. You may flag some errors and open new issues.

Read all bits of this document and that will guide you on how to participate.

## Discussion

### Mailing List

The Markdown Test Suite has been started a little bit after the start of the [Markdown Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/markdown/). You may want to discuss about Markdown and this project on the [group mailing-list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-markdown/).

## How to Report an Issue

Don't be afraid to add details to your issue. The more context you give, the better for people participating to the project. Make a short summary, add a description with the context and give links to places which will help to understand.

## Editing Markdown Specification

There is much needed work on the [Markdown Specification](https://github.com/karlcow/markdown-testsuite/blob/master/markdown-spec.html) (source). It doesn't require strong competences in coding. Be systematic in the markup and follow the way it is already organized. Each time you added a new atomic section, create a commit for this specific part.

## Test Suite Guidelines

When proposing new tests, make sure they do not already exist in the current test suite. You will notice that there is a separate section dedicated to the specific extensions that some markdown generators have created. Keep them separate. We want to keep the core clean and close to the original specification of Markdown.

If you are not sure, create an issue.

## Commits and Pull Requests

* Keep your commits clean and commented
* Do not mix in one commit different things. Keep modifications related.
* Do not mix everything in one giant pull request. Create separate pull requests for different topic. That will help to have a more meaningful debate about the pull requests and will help to review the code.
* If it relates to a specific issue, add the number of the issue in the commit message.

Thanks for Contributing
