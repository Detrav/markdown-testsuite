      This specification defines the Markdown syntax, a very simple text markup for giving a minimum of structure to a text and still making it readable.

        This document has not been approved by any group yet. The intent is to produce a strawmann document which can be used by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/markdown/">Markdown Community Group</a> for defining what should be in a Markdown Specification.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <dfn>Markdown</dfn> is a text syntax created by John Gruber. etc. The content of the markup defined in this document is based on the initial Markdown Syntax as defined by John Gruber. The document might address syntax extension later on.

<h2>Syntax</h2>
<!--template for writing a feature of the language
<h3>Feature name</h3>

<p>A <dfn>feature</dfn> is… [description].</p>

<h4 class="informative">Examples</h4>

<pre class="example">Example code</pre>

<h4>Processing</h4>

<p>How a parser should process the feature.@describe the step and the unicode character.</p>

<p class="issue">Describe Issue</p>

<h4>HTML output</h4>

<p>What should be the output</p>

-->

<h3>Standalone Paragraph</h3>

<p>A <dfn>standalone paragraph</dfn> is a unit of text on one or more contiguous lines. Authors can use 0 to 3 leading spaces and 1 trailing space.</p>

<h4 class="informative">Examples</h4>

<pre class="example">This is a paragraph on a single line.

This is another paragraph
but on multiple lines.

 This is another way
 to create paragraphs
 with leading spaces.</pre>

<h4>Processing</h4>

<p>A paragraph starts with 0 to 3 spaces (U+0020) followed by any characters, except the following characters <code>*</code> (U+002A), <code>-</code> (U+002D), <code>+</code> (U+002B), <code>></code>(U+003E).</p>

<p>The paragraphs ends with a carriage return CR (U+000D) followed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any spaces or tabs and another carriage return CR (U+000D).</li>
  <li>or End Of File</li>
</ul>

<p class="issue">Should a parser remove the leading characters spaces.</p>
<p class="issue">To test tabs at the ends of a carriage return. See paragraph-trailing-tab.md test.</p>
<p class="issue">What is happening to a multiline paragraph when converted to HTML? normalize as a long line, kept as is with the carriage return? What about eventual leading and trailing spaces.</p>

<h4>HTML output</h4>

<p>An HTML producer MUST output a <code>P</code> element start tag followed by the content and MUST end with the <code>P</code> element end tag.</p>

<p class="issue">Addressing the trailing/leading space characters in the processing or in the HTML output. Maybe better in the processing section to be able to produce in more than one format.</p>

<h3>Line break</h3>

<p>A <dfn>line break</dfn> is a way for authors to break a paragraph in the middle. Authors can use two trailing spaces and a return at the end of a line to insert a line break in a paragraph.</p>

<h4 class="informative">Examples</h4>
<pre class="example">This is a paragraph␠␠
with an effective line break.</pre>

<h4>Processing</h4>

<p>A line break is created when there are two trailing spaces characters (U+0020) followed by a carriage return CR (U+000D).</p>

<p class="issue">To test what is happening with 3 or more trailing spaces.</p>
<p class="issue">To test what is happening when this is the end of the paragraph. Should it be removed or kept.</p>

<h4>HTML output</h4>

<p>An HTML producer MUST output a <code>BR</code> element.</p>

<h3>Headings</h3>

<p>A <dfn>heading</dfn> is a string of text for marking up headings with 1 to 6 levels. The heading must be on one and only one line. It must not have any leading space characters. There are 3 ways of marking up headings.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Leading Hash sign</dt>
<dd>The author must must put hash sign (<code>#</code>) at the beginning of the line followed by 0 or 1 space and the heading string. 1 hash sign for a level 1 heading to 6 hash signs for a level 6 heading.</dd>
<dt>Nesting Hash sign</dt>
<dd>In addition to the previous rules for leading hash sign, the author must close with 0 to 1 space and the same number of hash signs <code>#</code>.</dd>
<dt>Underlines (<strong>level 1 and 2 only</strong>)</dt>
<dd>For level 1 heading, the author must put at the next line after the heading string a series of equal signs (<code>=</code>) of the same length than the heading.</dd>
<dd>For level 2 heading, the author must put at the next line after the heading string a series of dash signs (<code>-</code>) of the same length than the heading.</dd>
</dl>

<h4 class="informative">Examples</h4>

<pre class="example">
# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
#### Heading level 4
##### Heading level 5
###### Heading level 6

# Heading level 1 #
## Heading level 2 ##
### Heading level 3 ###
#### Heading level 4 ####
##### Heading level 5 #####
###### Heading level 6 ######

Heading level 1
===============

Heading level 2
---------------
</pre>

<h4>Processing</h4>

<p>.</p>

<p class="issue">trailing hash signs are not significant. This has to be explained clearly in the processing part.</p>
<p class="issue">leading spaces are forbidden. To check.</p>
<p class="issue">Is the length of the undeline string (=, -) significant. To check. Seems not.</p>
<p class="issue">Verify the combination of # and underline markup.</p>

<h4>HTML output</h4>

<h2>Markdown filename extension</h2>

<p>An extension filename is a common way to identify a file on a Operating System and for authoring tools. Currently there are a number of extensions which have been used in the wild for handling markdown documents. Here is a list of some of these</p>

<ul>
  <li>.md</li>
  <li>.mdown</li>
  <li>.markdown</li>
  <li>.mkd</li>
  <li>.markdn</li>
</ul>

<p class="issue">Should there be only one normative extension filename for everyone to use? And make a note for deprecating the others as parseable but not conformant for producing tools.</p>

</section>

<section class="informative">

<h2>Markup layout style guidelines</h2>
<p>Authors and authoring tools are encouraged to use a fixed-width font for editing markdown document. It will be a lot easier to read and write.</p>
